        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Hello, I'm Ryan. I am a 20 year old musician based out of <strong>Nunavut</strong>.
            <br>I grew up my entire life in <em>Iqaluit, Nunavut</em> and recently moved to Ottawa to
            further my studies.
            <br>I'm currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College, and
            created this website for my <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Semantics Assignment in Web
            Development.

        <h3> Music & Me </h3>
        <p>I've taken 3 years of guitar classes in my high school, and just before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I
            bought an electric guitar and taught myself through online videos throughout the course of the Covid-19
            pandemic.
            <br>Since the beginning of 2023, I have released multiple singles and recently released my debut album <q><a

            You can find my music and most of my social media handles under <q><strong><a
